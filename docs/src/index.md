# Overview

Dealroadshow K8S Framework is an open-source framework that allows you to define [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
manifests using PHP and full power of [Symfony Framework](https://symfony.com).

You then may generate standard YAML manifests and apply them to your Kubernetes cluster.

Please see [How to read this docs](how-to-read.md) before diving deeper into other articles.

Take a look at [our vision](vision.md) if you want to decide whether K8S Framework is a good tool for you and to compare it with similar popular tools.

Head to [Installation](installation.md) page for installation instructions.
In order to quickly start writing your manifests, see [Getting started](getting-started.md).

Read about important basic concepts of K8S Framework, such as [Manifests](concepts/manifests.md), [Containers](concepts/containers.md) and [Apps](concepts/apps.md) before jumping to complex topics, such as [Manifest methods interception](methods-interception.md) and [Environments management](env-management.md).
